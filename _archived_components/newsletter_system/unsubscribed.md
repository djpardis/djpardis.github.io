# üëã You've been unsubscribed

Your email has been successfully removed from the newsletter list.

## Sorry to see you go

I understand that newsletters aren't for everyone. Thanks for giving it a try!

## Stay connected

Even though you won't receive email updates, you can still:

- **Visit the blog**: [Browse latest posts]({{ site.baseurl }}/blog/)
- **Follow on social**: Stay updated through social media
- **RSS feed**: Subscribe to the [RSS feed]({{ site.baseurl }}/feed.xml) instead

## Changed your mind?

If you unsubscribed by mistake, you can [subscribe again]({{ site.baseurl }}/#newsletter) anytime.

## Feedback welcome

If you have a moment, I'd love to know why you unsubscribed. Feel free to [send me a message]({{ site.baseurl }}/contact/) with any feedback.
