## Overview
A newsletter signup form has been added to the footer of your site. It's currently set up with placeholder functionality. Follow these steps to connect it to Buttondown.

## Step 1: Create Buttondown Account

Visit Blog | Unsubscribe | Website

djpardis • Newsletter
```

### **🔗 Unsubscribe Link Behavior:**
- **Click "Unsubscribe"** → Takes user to `https://djpardis.github.io/unsubscribed/`
- **One-click option** → Also available for instant unsubscribe (regulation compliant)
- **Custom goodbye page** → Professional, branded experience
- **Optional confirmation email** → Kind farewell message

## Buttondown advantages
- ✅ **Free tier:** 1,000 subscribers, unlimited emails
- ✅ **No ads** in your emails (unlike Mailchimp free tier)
- ✅ **Markdown support** for beautiful newsletters
- ✅ **Developer-friendly** with great API and webhooks
- ✅ **Clean, minimal** interface
- ✅ **Excellent deliverability**
- ✅ **Privacy-focused** (GDPR compliant)
- ✅ **Full unsubscribe control** with custom landing pages

## How it works
The form uses AJAX to submit to Buttondown without redirecting:
```javascript
// Submits to: https://buttondown.email/api/emails/embed-subscribe/pardis
// Shows success message on your site (no redirect)
```

## Troubleshooting
- **Form not working?** Check browser console for JavaScript errors
- **No subscribers appearing?** Verify in Buttondown dashboard after a few minutes
- **CORS errors?** This is normal - Buttondown may block cross-origin requests but still processes the subscription
