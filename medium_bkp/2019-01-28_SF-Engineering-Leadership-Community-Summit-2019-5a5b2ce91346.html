Thanks to Jan Chong for the invitation!</p><p name="ace3" id="ace3" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">In this post, I summarize some of the discussions and lessons from the talks and panels that I attended.</p></div></div></section><section name="0176" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="9580" id="9580" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">We started the day with a keynote by <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">James Everingham</strong>, Facebook&#39;s Head of Engineering. He drew parallels between management and quantum theory.</p><p name="b5cd" id="b5cd" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The main takeaway was the importance of not being prescriptive as a manager. He talked about the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">observer effect,</em> <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">authority bias,</em> and the team’s reluctance to develop their ideas when the manager gives a solution. Instead, a manager’s job should be to ask probing questions.</p><p name="1233" id="1233" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He also talked about creating the right amount of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">entanglement</em> on the team. Build a culture of empathy, camaraderie, and clear communication.</p><p name="3c98" id="3c98" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He suggested embracing <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">self-observation</em> and accepting that we are always in a state of both success and failure.</p><p name="acda" id="acda" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the next talk I attended, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Jonathan Raymond</strong>, Founder and CEO of Refound, drew parallels between management and sales. Just like sales, management helps people see the gap between where they are and where they could be; it is the task of clarifying the cost of inaction.</p><p name="3115" id="3115" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He also talked about people’s desire to see projects completed. If you terminate a project, be clear about when it will be reprioritized.</p><p name="f313" id="f313" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">In the fireside chat hosted by <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ben Jun</strong> (CEO at HVF Labs),<strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong"> Max Levchin</strong> (Founder and CEO of Affirm) had some good advice about focusing on valuable problems as opposed to hard problems. There’s a mindset shift as you get into the industry from school. You are conditioned to look for complex problems in school, and working on easy problems feels like an insult. In industry, it doesn’t matter if a problem is cool or uncool, if it is easy or hard, you should work on what matters.</p><p name="fc5e" id="fc5e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He talked about how at PayPal, Peter Thiel was able to bring out the best in people by showing that he believed they could be better and do better.</p><p name="4bc7" id="4bc7" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regarding recruiting, he talked about the <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">aura test</em> or <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">hallway test</em>: is this a person you want to keep bumping into in the hallways? He talked about not making compromises in hiring. Surround yourself by people who are invested in your success. Friends, enablers, people who inspire you, and those who impress you. Don’t settle for less.</p><p name="66b1" id="66b1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After lunch, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Julia Grace</strong>, Senior Director of Infrastructure at Slack, spoke about the value in hiring product managers, among other roles. The roles you don’t hire for are things you and your team do by yourself.</p><p name="4f12" id="4f12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Later, <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Paw Anderson</strong>, Former Senior Director of Engineering at Uber, talked about the varying degrees of disagreement on teams. The quality of the disagreement determines the quality of the commitment. What you build at a company is new and complex. You are building groundbreaking technology. It is okay to be honest about not knowing things. Getting on the same page is very important before you get into a heated discussion. Here is his takeaway message:</p><blockquote name="c3ab" id="c3ab" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">Always let people know enough to disagree with you in a qualified way.</blockquote><p name="e718" id="e718" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Will Larson</strong>, Head of Foundation Engineering at Stripe, discussed best practices for designing organizational processes. One takeaway message was to allow anyone who cares about a project to have a chance to lead it. In cases when there are no volunteers, reach out and ask someone you think would be most suited. Your asking is a vote of confidence that is welcome motivation for successful project delivery.</p><p name="dc5b" id="dc5b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">Roll out a new process slowly and be open to its evolution. Do not overdesign at the outset. People organically adopt good processes because they solve real problems. Do not force processes.</p></div></div></section><section name="d616" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="4913" id="4913" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">Then, there was a wonderful panel moderated by <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Sam Wholley</strong>, Partner at Riviera, to discuss the question, “What makes a great VPE?”</p><p name="8bf2" id="8bf2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Karthik Rau</strong>, Founder and CEO of SignalFx, sees a VPE as someone who is able to connect the dots better than anyone and communicate the strategy effectively to get everyone’s buy-in. A VPE needs to be skilled in building organizations. When hiring a new VPE, you should bring someone with traits that complement those on the leads team and someone who can be a source of positive change. You should also assess whether they can take risks. Have they taken big risks? Do they handle risk well? Will they succeed in a role despite being set up for failure?</p><p name="a453" id="a453" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He also called for an unbiased hiring process for VPEs. One of the best ways to achieve this is by setting clear criteria for everyone involved in the interviews.</p><p name="b0cc" id="b0cc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">His advice to those seeking this type of role is to find mentors and be mentors. These people will keep you in mind when a role opens up. Take some chances, take risks, and don’t be afraid.</p><p name="520f" id="520f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Evan Kaplan</strong>, CEO at InfluxData, believes that great leaders are model builders and can describe their work well to others. Great VPEs optimize the delivery of the company&#39;s mission as opposed to the mission of the engineering organization. In the interviews, he looks for someone who is authentic and consistent, who owns their story, who can establish rapport and is emotionally intelligent, and finally, who is credible as endorsed by others. In hiring, he reminds us to counter our biases consciously.</p><p name="d016" id="d016" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To those who are trying to get promoted into a VPE role, his advice is to try to fit in, but not for too long. Sometimes, you need to go somewhere else to find someone who is willing to take a bet on you. Get coffee with hiring managers to understand their criteria and learn and bounce ideas.</p><p name="eaf5" id="eaf5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Bret Reckard</strong>, Director of Human Capital at Sequoia Capital, cares about how potential candidates see Engineering as part of the whole and how they understand product plans to guide Engineering execution. Are they good at storytelling? Do they care about people? Can they be mentors as well as managers?</p><p name="3a34" id="3a34" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">His advice to those seeking this role is that you need to be driven. Nobody is just going to offer you this role, and you can’t expect to be recognized.</p><p name="1414" id="1414" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Holly Rose Faith</strong>, Talent Partner at NEA, discussed potential VPEs&#39; hiring capabilities. It matters how quickly they can identify good talent, bring them in, and sign them. She also identified self-awareness as an important trait. She asked potential candidates to talk about a situation where they would have done things differently and to identify things that didn’t go well.</p><p name="e756" id="e756" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Regarding hiring biases, she suggests that the internal hiring funnel be matched, at the very least, to that of the market.</p><p name="6938" id="6938" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">To those seeking this role, her advice is to ask for feedback in order to gain awareness on where you stand.</p><p name="f308" id="f308" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Sam</strong> then talked about several anti-patterns to watch out for when hiring a VPE. Beware of arrogance and those who only <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">manage up</em>.</p><p name="be1c" id="be1c" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">His advice to those seeking this role is to build relationships with talent partners at firms and not be afraid to apply for any open roles.</p></div></div></section><section name="9754" class="section section--body"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="9eda" id="9eda" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">After this panel, I missed a few talks as I went for a walk and a froyo run. However, I was able to meet and chat with several amazing managers and authors.</p><p name="edb1" id="edb1" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">After my stroll, I attended a talk by <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Ron Lichty</strong>, author of Managing the Unmanageable. He talked about the Agile Method. Micromanagement cultures are not suitable for Agile. Honor everybody’s expertise on the team. Rather than telling people what to do, support and trust them to determine how something is done. Protect the team from all the noise and guard against the evil of multitasking. Multitasking is a killer of joy, of focus, and of quality.</p><p name="99b0" id="99b0" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Programming is a team sport. Create a culture of effective communication and collaboration. It’s generally a bad idea to have an EM or PM be a scrum master. They visit the team three times a day to ask, “Is it done yet?” It is best to have Scrum masters who can’t affect people’s performance reviews. Scrum masters should focus on optimizing collaboration.</p><p name="127f" id="127f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p"><a href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" data-href="https://agilemanifesto.org/" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Values and principles</a> should come before practices and processes. Just as voting does not make a democracy, Agile practices are insufficient to ensure Agile development.</p><p name="4af5" id="4af5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He said, despite his not knowing anything about basketball, he recommends the following two books by Phil Jackson, the head coach of the Chicago Bulls from 1989 to 1998 (he inherited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls#1984%E2%80%931998:_The_Michael_Jordan_era" data-href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chicago_Bulls#1984%E2%80%931998:_The_Michael_Jordan_era" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">MJ</a>):</p><ul class="postList"><li name="5cbc" id="5cbc" class="graf graf--li graf-after--p"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Hoops-Spiritual-Lessons-Hardwood/dp/1401308813" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Sacred-Hoops-Spiritual-Lessons-Hardwood/dp/1401308813" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Sacred Hoops</a></li><li name="a684" id="a684" class="graf graf--li graf-after--li"><a href="https://www.amazon.com/Eleven-Rings-Success-Phil-Jackson/dp/0143125346" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Eleven-Rings-Success-Phil-Jackson/dp/0143125346" class="markup--anchor markup--li-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Eleven Rings</a></li></ul><p name="ef0d" id="ef0d" class="graf graf--p graf-after--li">Another basketball coach he finds inspiring is Coach Kerr of the GSW. He later found out that Kerr used to play for Jackson!</p><figure name="784e" id="784e" class="graf graf--figure graf--iframe graf-after--p"><blockquote class="twitter-tweet"><a href="https://twitter.com/jack/status/910610392769892352"></a></blockquote><script async src="https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js" charset="utf-8"></script></figure><p name="5d89" id="5d89" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">After dinner, we had one keynote and two fireside discussions. The first keynote was by <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Fred Kofman</strong>, Leadership Development Advisor at Google. He started the talk by addressing the dangers of optimizing for product-level KPIs, rather than overall goals. Consider a soccer game. If you’re on defense and your KPI is to minimize goals, you would prefer the whole team to lose 0–1 rather than win 5–4 because the latter would make you look better. In this scenario, even if you know your job and what’s good for the team, you can’t do it because it’s not how you will be assessed.</p><p name="279a" id="279a" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The biggest problem we face in management is that there is no theory of everything, no optimal solution, and we are bound to falter and die.</p><p name="990e" id="990e" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Next, he discussed the dangers of <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">moral hazard</em> at a company. This pertains to everything from headcount to the amount and quality of contributions by everyone. When you cannot calculate the marginal contribution of people, quality will suffer. Average pay drives the best away.</p><p name="8e0f" id="8e0f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">He then talked about F. A. Hayek’s views on management show the following quote, which reiterates the lack of an optimal organizational structure:</p><figure name="d7e0" id="d7e0" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*vrJC2IvsRsuwlOgSdpvhnQ.jpeg" data-width="3024" data-height="4032" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*vrJC2IvsRsuwlOgSdpvhnQ.jpeg"></figure><p name="3c47" id="3c47" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">This is an unsolvable problem, but you don’t need to solve it! You just need to solve it better than others. “In the land of the blind, the one-eyed man is king.”</p><figure name="c3f7" id="c3f7" class="graf graf--figure graf-after--p"><img class="graf-image" data-image-id="1*9rp7QyjdB-T7AJuGI6ELQA.png" data-width="491" data-height="163" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/800/1*9rp7QyjdB-T7AJuGI6ELQA.png"><figcaption class="imageCaption">From <a href="https://wordtothewise.com/2015/09/outrunning-the-bear/" data-href="https://wordtothewise.com/2015/09/outrunning-the-bear/" class="markup--anchor markup--figure-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">here</a>.</figcaption></figure><p name="df28" id="df28" class="graf graf--p graf-after--figure">He also talked about providing non-material reasons for people to do their best. How do you engage people not because it is convenient but because they are genuinely intrigued? This is not about solving an engineering problem, it is about changing the context in which people solve an engineering problem.</p><p name="ec12" id="ec12" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Humans need to transcend and create lasting things. Business is our best chance.</p><p name="53b9" id="53b9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Next, we attended a fireside chat hosted by <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Dan Portillo</strong>, Former Talent Partner at Greylock Partners. <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Aditya Agarwal</strong>, Former CTO at Dropbox and Partner-in-Residence at South Park Commons, had some good recruiting advice from his days at Dropbox. The main takeaway was to take the long view on recruiting. You have 30–45 minutes to make a good impression on someone. Show that you care about the person and their career above all else. In many cases, if they don’t accept, they will send recommendations or join later.</p><p name="b530" id="b530" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">We are incredibly lazy when closing a candidate. We can do a lot more. Understand if the candidate has any questions left. They might have concerns about finding the right resources for their spouse and children. They might not be clear about the reporting structure and manager. Be mindful, make promises, and keep them. Life is a small circle. Do good.</p><p name="a08b" id="a08b" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Engineering managers determine the limits of a company&#39;s throughput.</p><p name="7734" id="7734" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">Make sure to value people who are always there, and people who take on the non-glorious tasks. If they’ve done many small things but no shiny projects, make sure you reward them. The easy thing is to reward the shiny project, but shiny projects are not always the most necessary.</p><p name="ece5" id="ece5" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The last fireside chat of the night was hosted by <strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Sarah Guo</strong>, General Partner at Greylock Partners. Reid Hoffman, Co-Founder of LinkedIn and Partner at Greylock Partners, talked about his new book entitled <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Blitzscaling-Lightning-Fast-Building-Massively-Companies/dp/1524761419" data-href="https://www.amazon.com/Blitzscaling-Lightning-Fast-Building-Massively-Companies/dp/1524761419" class="markup--anchor markup--p-anchor" rel="noopener" target="_blank">Blitzscaling: The Lightning-Fast Path to Building Massively Valuable Companies</a>.</p><p name="c8e9" id="c8e9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">The main takeaway here was that it’s important to prioritize speed over efficiency in a competitive environment. To determine where to stand in this tradeoff, always ask which risk is bigger: to scale or to be efficient? This depends on your competition.</p><p name="ce72" id="ce72" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When asked about his motivation for sharing this winning strategy with companies outside of Greylock, he said,</p><blockquote name="c8c6" id="c8c6" class="graf graf--pullquote graf-after--p">While we compete intensely, we collaborate intensely. This is what makes us great.</blockquote><p name="5af2" id="5af2" class="graf graf--p graf-after--pullquote">I find this to be very inspiring. The best environments for growth are those with a culture of knowledge sharing. We are all in this together.</p><p name="eed9" id="eed9" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">When asked about the current “techlash” and the downsides of the culture of moving fast and breaking things, he responded that it’s important that you choose which risks you are willing to take. You shouldn’t move fast on things that could heavily slow you down in the future and interrupt your ability to live and compete.</p><p name="233f" id="233f" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p graf--trailing">We concluded the night with an awards ceremony, recognizing great engineering managers.</p></div></div></section><section name="ae5f" class="section section--body section--last"><div class="section-divider"><hr class="section-divider"></div><div class="section-content"><div class="section-inner sectionLayout--insetColumn"><p name="a5e5" id="a5e5" class="graf graf--p graf--leading">This was a well-organized summit, thanks to <a href="https://medium.com/u/abc6f67acd70" data-href="https://medium.com/u/abc6f67acd70" data-anchor-type="2" data-user-id="abc6f67acd70" data-action-value="abc6f67acd70" data-action="show-user-card" data-action-type="hover" class="markup--user markup--p-user" target="_blank"><strong class="markup--strong markup--p-strong">Jerry Li</strong></a> and the many organizers and volunteers at SFELC.</p><p name="c1bc" id="c1bc" class="graf graf--p graf-after--p">PS I missed <em class="markup--em markup--p-em">a lot</em> of great talks.
