# Episode 1: Welcome to 107 Wins

## Opening

Hey there, I'm Pardis Noorzad, and welcome to 107 Wins.

So this is episode one. The big debut. I've been thinking about doing this forever, but now is the right time. This is a podcast about building businesses, learning from failures, and figuring out what actually works when everyone else is just theorizing about it.

## The Name

Okay, let me explain the name because people keep asking.

[Note: Our podcast name actually celebrates the 2021 San Francisco Giants' franchise-record 107 regular season wins, honoring that historic achievement.]

As you know, I love Moneyball, and I should say that season was very Oakland A's coded. And we had Zaidi at the helm, so it's not surprising.  

## What This Is

Look, I'm not here to give you the same generic business advice you can get from any LinkedIn post. I'm here to share what I've actually learned from building companies, from watching them fail spectacularly, from watching other people succeed and fail, and from trying to figure out the patterns that actually matter.

We're going to talk about:
- Building products that people actually need, not just want
- What fundraising is really like when the cameras are off
- How to build teams that don't just function but actually excel
- The psychological reality of being a founder that nobody talks about

## Meet Jenni

I went to a Giants game with my friend Jenni recently, and it reminded me why she's one of the most impressive salespeople I've ever met. Not because she's aggressive or pushy - she's actually the opposite. She just understands people in a way that's almost uncanny.

She's closed deals worth millions, built sales teams from nothing, and has this network of founders, VCs, and operators who are actually building things. Not talking about building things - actually building them. There's a huge difference.

Jenni's going to be a co-host on sales episodes because she has insights that most people either don't have or won't share publicly. We're talking about the real mechanics of how deals actually get done, not the surface-level stuff that fills business books.

## Why Start a Podcast Now

I'm actually a late adopter. I know, crazy. I joined Tumblr in 2012 when it was already mainstream. I got on Clubhouse in 2021, months after the hype peaked. But when I do adopt, I go all in.

For context, my first Medium post was in 2018, years after everyone said blogging was dead. But I went all in once I started.

I've been thinking about starting a podcast for years, waiting for the perfect moment, the right equipment, the perfect setup. Then I realized something obvious: there's no perfect time. You just have to start.

[Enhanced context: The podcast industry has grown exponentially - from 700,000 active podcasts in 2018 to over 5 million today. But according to Spotify's research, only 23% of podcasters publish more than 10 episodes. The secret isn't having perfect conditions; it's consistency and actually shipping content.]

[More context: Here's what's interesting about podcasting right now: we're in a golden age of intimate, long-form conversation. While everyone else is fighting for attention in 15-second clips, podcasts give us space to actually explore ideas. The medium rewards depth, authenticity, and real expertise - exactly what's missing from most business content today.]

What I love about podcasts is the authentic conversations that happen. The kind of discussions that usually happen in private Slack channels, Zoom calls, and coffee meetings are now shared publicly. I remember when Twitter had this energy - I actually joined because I found a thread between two prominent Twitter engineers, Oscar Boykin and another engineer, solving a problem I was researching. That's when I realized: this is where the real conversations are happening, and I need to be part of it.

## The Consistency Thing

Speaking of building things consistently, here's what I've learned about forming habits, and it's probably the most important thing I'll tell you today: you need deadlines, not motivation.

I've set every Tuesday as my recording day. Good hair day, bad hair day, feeling inspired or completely uninspired - doesn't matter. The calendar decides, not my mood.

This applies to everything: writing, coding, building products, working out. Set the deadline first, then work backwards. Motivation follows action, not the other way around. It's simple, but most people get it backwards.

[Enhanced context: This aligns perfectly with James Clear's research in "Atomic Habits," where he demonstrates that "You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems." Clear's work, backed by behavioral psychology studies, shows that people who create implementation intentions - specific time and location plans like "at 8:00 AM, when I'm in my office, I will work on my priority project" - achieve their goals 91% of the time compared to 33% for those without systems. The research also reveals that missing a habit once is an accident, but missing twice starts a new (negative) habit. This is why my Tuesday deadline approach works - it creates what Clear calls "environment design" where the system matters more than motivation.]

## What I've Been Building

This brings me to what I've been building, because all of this connects to the lessons I want to share.

### General Folders
I founded General Folders in 2022. We're building secure data exchange solutions for enterprises, which sounds boring until you realize that companies literally cannot share data securely right now. It's a mess.

Our solution provides cross-company data transfer services that maintain privacy and compliance. We've raised pre-seed funding, built a team of 17 people, and joined Techstars SDSU. It's been wild.

[Enhanced context: The enterprise data sharing challenge is massive and growing. According to 2024 security research, data breach costs hit a record $4.88 million globally, with U.S. organizations facing $10.22 million per incident. Third-party data breaches - exactly what we're solving - cost 40% more than internal incidents and are 17 times more expensive to remediate. The B2B data exchange market is valued between $13.75 billion and $45 billion depending on how you measure it, with 7-25% annual growth rates. Only 33% of organizations achieve full data classification, and 47% more B2B data breaches occurred year-over-year in 2024. When companies can't share data securely, they either don't share it (limiting business opportunities) or share it insecurely (creating massive liability). We're building the infrastructure to solve this fundamental problem.]

### The Data Room App
I launched The Data Room App in 2024. Simple, secure data rooms for fundraising. I built it because existing solutions are over-engineered, ridiculously expensive, and don't actually solve the problems early-stage companies have.

[Enhanced context: Traditional data room solutions like Intralinks and Merrill charge $1,000-5,000+ per month for basic functionality that startups only need for 2-3 months during fundraising. Most founders end up using Dropbox or Google Drive, which creates security risks and looks unprofessional to investors. Our approach strips away enterprise bloat and focuses on the core workflow: secure document sharing with access controls and analytics.]

## Lessons from Early Stage

### Sales
Early-stage sales is brutal in ways that are hard to explain until you've lived it. You're selling a product that doesn't exist yet to people who don't know they need it. It's like trying to sell ice to someone who's never seen snow.

I've learned that the best salespeople are the ones who can translate technical capabilities into business outcomes. They don't sell features; they sell results. They understand that customers don't buy products - they buy solutions to problems.

[Enhanced context: The alternative is what Blank calls "Customer Development": getting out of the building and testing hypotheses with real customers before building anything. The key insight is that startups aren't smaller versions of large companies; they're temporary organizations searching for repeatable and scalable business models.]

### Customer Development
Building with customers is the only way to build the right thing. I've spent hundreds of hours on customer calls, understanding their workflows, their pain points, and the gap between what they say they want and what they actually need.

The insights from these conversations are gold. You learn things about your product that you never would have thought of. Customer development isn't just validation - it's discovery.

### Fundraising
Fundraising is a completely different skill from building products or selling to customers. It's not about having the best product or the biggest market. It's about telling a story that investors can see themselves in.

I've learned to frame everything in terms of market size, traction, and team. But the real skill is knowing which investors actually care about what you're building and speaking their language.

Here's what you don't realize about fundraising: your company gets presented alongside other startups pitching similar solutions. While you're thinking "this problem is so obvious, how can you not see it?" - the investor is comparing you to twenty other pitches that week. 

You want investors who already understand the problem exists. It's nearly impossible to convince someone of a new problem in a thirty-minute pitch. That's why the twentieth AI writing tool gets funded while genuinely innovative solutions in outdated industries struggle. Someone already did the work of creating the narrative about why AI writing is the future, regardless of where the technology actually stands today.

### Market Understanding
Markets are conversations, not static things. You need to understand not just what people say they want, but what they're actually willing to pay for. The gap between these two things is where most startups fail.

People will tell you they love your product, that it's exactly what they've been looking for. But that doesn't mean they'll pay for it. Understanding the difference between interest and purchasing intent is everything.

## What's Coming

All of this connects to what we'll cover in future episodes.

### Sales Deep Dive
Jenni and I are going to break down sales frameworks, negotiation tactics, and how to build a sales team from zero. We'll get into the psychology of selling, the mechanics of deal flow, and how to build lasting customer relationships.

### AI and Data Tools
I want to interview the people building the next generation of AI tools. How they're thinking about market opportunities, what problems they're solving, and how they're navigating this rapidly evolving landscape.

[Enhanced context: The AI tools market is experiencing unprecedented growth, with companies like OpenAI reaching $2 billion ARR faster than any B2B company in history. But according to Bessemer Venture Partners' research, 70% of AI startups are feature companies, not platform companies. We'll explore what makes sustainable AI businesses and how founders are building defensible moats in a rapidly commoditizing technology landscape.]

### Data Infrastructure
Conversations with engineers building data platforms. How they're scaling systems, what tools they're using, and how they're thinking about the future of data architecture.

### Fundraising Stories
Founders sharing their real fundraising journeys. The wins, the losses, the lessons learned. Real stories from people who've been through it and are willing to share the truth.

## Baseball and Sports Analytics

I love baseball. I love the analytics of it. 

I love baseball or other sports because it helps me unplug. My favorite is to watch sports at bars. With friends. With a little beer. 

## The Newsletter

I'll be sending a weekly newsletter that summarizes our conversations, shares insights, and previews upcoming episodes. Think of it as a companion piece to the podcast.

The newsletter will include:
- Key takeaways from each episode
- Links to resources and references we mention
- Updates on what we're building and learning
- Announcements about upcoming guests and topics

## Social Media

We're on YouTube for video clips and Instagram for behind-the-scenes stuff. Follow us to see the process of building this podcast and meet the people behind it.

## What's Next

Next week, Jenni and I are doing a deep dive into early-stage sales. How to build a sales process when you don't have a sales team, how to qualify leads effectively, and how to close deals that actually matter.

## Closing

Thanks for joining me on episode one of 107 Wins. This is just the beginning of what I hope will be a meaningful conversation about building companies, learning from failure, and finding success in unexpected places.

Remember: it's not about doing the basics perfectly. It's about going that extra mile, pushing past what everyone else is willing to do, and reaching that threshold where success becomes inevitable. It's about getting to 107 wins.

I'll see you next Tuesday.
