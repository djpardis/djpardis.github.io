Before we begin recording:
- Test your audio and video setup

### Audio equipment

**Recommended setup:**
- Apple microphones (including MacBook built-in mics) work well
- External microphones like Blue Yeti or Audio-Technica are also good options
- Position microphone 6-8 inches away from your mouth
- Wired headphones to prevent echo and feedback
- Quiet environment with minimal background noise

### Video & environment

**For best results:**
- Position camera at eye level (external webcam preferred)
- Face a light source; avoid being backlit
- Choose a clean, uncluttered background
- Use a wired internet connection when possible
- Find a quiet space with minimal echo

We're looking forward to a great discussion!
