![Data room app main interface](/files/pics/dataroom.png)
*The Data Room App ([thedataroom.app](https://thedataroom.app){:target="_blank"}) provides a clean, intuitive interface for investors to access confidential documents.*

In the first part of this series, I shared my experience with vibe coding using Windsurf to build a custom data room application for startups. I discussed why existing data room solutions didn't meet my needs and also highlighted best practices for working with AI coding assistants.

Now, in the second part, I'll focus on one of the most critical aspects of any application: secure authentication. Specifically, I'll walk through implementing magic link authentication with Replit, a passwordless approach that enhances security while providing a seamless user experience for investors accessing confidential documents.

## Why Replit

I tried initially to implement magic links with Windsurf. Given that auth flows are not my area of expertise, I wasn't able to fully build a magic link authentication flow and needed more opinionated help. I tried Replit which provided a quick and working solution.

[Replit](https://replit.com){:target="_blank"} is a browser-based IDE and hosting platform that started in 2016 as a simple code playground but has evolved into a comprehensive development environment. Founded by Amjad Masad, Haya Odeh, and Faris Masad, it's now focused on making software development more accessible and collaborative. What drew me to it was its ability to handle full-stack applications with built-in authentication systems and serverless deployments, all without requiring complex DevOps knowledge.

## Replit vs Windsurf: technical comparison

### Authentication and session management

Replit's integrated authentication blueprints provide pre-configured [Passport.js](https://www.passportjs.org/){:target="_blank"} setups, session store integration with PostgreSQL, and automatic HTTPS for secure cookie handling. Magic link authentication was implemented in 15 minutes compared to hours of OAuth configuration debugging.

### Database integration

Instant PostgreSQL provisioning through [Neon](https://neon.tech){:target="_blank"} with zero configuration. Connection strings, pooling, and SSL certificates are handled automatically. [Drizzle ORM](https://drizzleorm.com){:target="_blank"} integration works seamlessly with database push deployments without migration file management.

### Deployment infrastructure

Zero-config deployment to custom domains with automatic HTTPS, environment variable management, and container orchestration. The platform handles load balancing and scaling automatically. Replit eliminated infrastructure bottlenecks including server configuration, database setup, and SSL certificate management.

### Replit limitations

Git operations lack the fluidity of native terminal workflows. Even basic branching and commit management feel clunky in the interface. What would be simple git commands in a terminal become multi-step processes with less feedback and control.

File system access is limited by the container abstraction, making certain debugging scenarios more difficult. System-level performance profiling and direct file manipulation are restricted.

### Windsurf trade-offs

Windsurf provides control with traditional Git workflows, full file system access, and familiar terminal operations. However, the setup overhead for authentication, databases, and deployment significantly slows initial development velocity compared to Replit's integrated infrastructure.

## Data room platform implementation

### Technical stack
- React frontend with TypeScript and shadcn/ui components
- Express.js backend with PostgreSQL database
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- JWT-based authentication with 7-day token expiration

### Architecture decisions

- **Simple content management**: Founders can organize their data room using a simple Markdown file, just like writing documentation. No clunky admin panels.

*Changes to sections.md are reflected instantly - no rebuild required.*

- **Flexible document handling**: The app supports both direct file uploads (protected by authentication) and links to existing documents in Google Drive or Dropbox.

- **Passwordless authentication**: Investors access the data room through magic links sent to their email - no passwords to forget or manage.

- **Role-based access**: Different permissions for founders (who pay for the service) and investors (who get free access), with no account creation required for investors.

- **Engagement analytics**: Founders can see which documents investors have viewed and when, providing valuable feedback on investor interest.

- **Frictionless invitations**: Founders can invite investors with a simple email, generating secure access tokens automatically.

## Implementation results

The platform is deployed at [thedataroom.app](https://thedataroom.app) and operates in waitlist mode for market validation.

## Technical implementation details

Beyond the core features, I implemented several technical components that were critical to the app's success:

### Secure session management

I implemented PostgreSQL-backed sessions with automatic cleanup and secure cookie handling. Thanks to Replit's integrated setup, this took only 5 minutes instead of the day-long process it would typically require.

### Reliable email delivery

The app uses production SMTP integration for reliable delivery of magic links and invitations. During development, I configured the system to log emails to the console for easy testing without worrying about deliverability issues.

### Robust file security

The system enforces a 50MB upload limit with strict type validation and secure storage. All uploaded documents require authentication to access, while external links leverage the existing permission systems of services like Google Drive and Dropbox.

- Week 1: Authentication and data modeling implementation
- Week 2: Document management and UI development
- Week 3: Email system integration and production deployment

## Feedback request

If you have past experience with data rooms, I'd love to hear your thoughts on the platform. If you're going to be needing a data room soon, I'd love to show you what we've built and get your feedback.

**Live platform:** [thedataroom.app](https://thedataroom.app)

**Access:** Waitlist signups receive discounted pricing; investor access remains free but you would need an invite.
