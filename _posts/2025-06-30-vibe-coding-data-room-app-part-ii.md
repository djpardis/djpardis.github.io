In [the first part](/blog/2025/06/20/vibe-coding-data-room-app/){:target="_blank"} of this series, I shared my experience with _vibe coding_ using Windsurf to build a custom data room application for startups. I discussed why existing data room solutions didn't meet my needs and also highlighted best practices for working with AI coding assistants.

Now, in the second part, I'll focus on one of the most critical aspects of any application: secure authentication. Specifically, I'll walk through implementing magic link authentication with Replit, a passwordless approach that enhances security while providing a seamless user experience for investors accessing confidential documents.

<!-- ## Why magic link authentication?

For a data room application, security is paramount. Traditional password-based authentication comes with several drawbacks:

1. **Password fatigue**: Investors often need to remember dozens of passwords, leading to password reuse or weak passwords.
2. **Security vulnerabilities**: Password-based systems are susceptible to brute force attacks, credential stuffing, and phishing.
3. **User friction**: The need to create and remember yet another password creates unnecessary friction during the fundraising process.

Magic link authentication addresses these issues by:

1. **Eliminating passwords entirely**: No passwords to forget, reuse, or compromise.
2. **Leveraging existing email security**: If an investor's email is secure, their access to your data room is secure.
3. **Reducing friction**: Investors simply enter their email and click a link to gain access.
4. **Providing audit trails**: Each magic link is unique and timestamped, creating clear records of access attempts. -->

## Why Replit

I tried initially to implement magic links with Windsurf. Given that I'm not an expert, I wasn't able to fully build a magic link authentication flow and needed more opinionated help. I tried [Replit](https://replit.com){:target="_blank"} which provided a quick and working solution.

[Replit](https://replit.com){:target="_blank"} is a browser-based IDE and hosting platform that started in 2016 as a simple code playground but has evolved into a comprehensive development environment. Founded by Amjad Masad, Haya Odeh, and Faris Masad, it's now focused on making software development more accessible and collaborative. What drew me to it was its ability to handle full-stack applications with built-in authentication systems and serverless deployments, all without requiring complex DevOps knowledge.

Unlike more complex authentication providers that require extensive configuration, Replit's approach is straightforward: create a project, implement authentication with their SDK, and deploy with a single click. For someone who needs a working solution quickly without becoming an auth expert, it's ideal. Their [documentation](https://docs.replit.com){:target="_blank"} is also refreshingly clear and to the point.


## Try it out

As promised in the first part, you can now try out the data room application yourself. Visit [thedataroom.app](https://thedataroom.app){:target="_blank"} and enter your email to request access.
