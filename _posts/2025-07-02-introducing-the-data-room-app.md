In the first part of this series, I shared my experience with vibe coding using Windsurf to build a custom data room application for startups. I discussed why existing data room solutions didn't meet my needs and also highlighted best practices for working with AI coding assistants.

Now, in the second part, I'll focus on one of the most critical aspects of any application: secure authentication. Specifically, I'll walk through implementing magic link authentication with Replit, a passwordless approach that enhances security while providing a seamless user experience for investors accessing confidential documents.

## Why Replit

I tried initially to implement magic links with Windsurf. Given that I'm not an expert, I wasn't able to fully build a magic link authentication flow and needed more opinionated help. I tried Replit which provided a quick and working solution.

Replit is a browser-based IDE and hosting platform that started in 2016 as a simple code playground but has evolved into a comprehensive development environment. Founded by Amjad Masad, Haya Odeh, and Faris Masad, it's now focused on making software development more accessible and collaborative. What drew me to it was its ability to handle full-stack applications with built-in authentication systems and serverless deployments, all without requiring complex DevOps knowledge.

## Replit vs Windsurf: Technical comparison

**Authentication and session management**
Replit's integrated authentication blueprints provide pre-configured Passport.js setups, session store integration with PostgreSQL, and automatic HTTPS for secure cookie handling. Magic link authentication was implemented in 15 minutes compared to hours of OAuth configuration debugging.

**Database integration**
Instant PostgreSQL provisioning through Neon with zero configuration. Connection strings, pooling, and SSL certificates are handled automatically. Drizzle ORM integration works seamlessly with database push deployments without migration file management.

**Deployment infrastructure**
Zero-config deployment to custom domains with automatic HTTPS, environment variable management, and container orchestration. The platform handles load balancing and scaling automatically.

**Development performance**
Pre-warmed containers provide instant startup times. Hot reloading across full-stack TypeScript applications is significantly faster than traditional setups.

**Replit limitations**

Git operations are less sophisticated than native terminal workflows. Branch visualization is basic and merge conflict resolution lacks the polish of dedicated Git clients. Complex branching strategies feel constrained.

File system access is limited by the container abstraction, making certain debugging scenarios more difficult. System-level performance profiling and direct file manipulation are restricted.

Dependency management troubleshooting can be more opaque due to the abstraction layer, reducing visibility into npm package conflict resolution.

**Windsurf trade-offs**

Windsurf provides complete control with traditional Git workflows, full file system access, and familiar terminal operations. However, the setup overhead for authentication, databases, and deployment significantly slows initial development velocity compared to Replit's integrated infrastructure.

## Data room platform implementation

**Technical stack**
- React frontend with TypeScript and shadcn/ui components
- Express.js backend with PostgreSQL database
- Drizzle ORM for type-safe database operations
- JWT-based authentication with 7-day token expiration

**Architecture decisions**

Markdown-driven content management through a `sections.md` file allows founders to edit data room structure like documentation without complex admin interfaces.

Dual document strategy supports both uploaded files requiring authentication and external links to Google Drive/Dropbox using native permissions.

Magic link authentication eliminates password friction while maintaining security through time-limited JWT tokens sent via email.

Role-based access control supports founder accounts (paid) and investor access (free) without account creation barriers.

Document access logging provides audit trails for tracking investor engagement with materials.

Email invitation system enables secure token-based access for investors without signup friction.

## Implementation results

The platform is deployed at [thedataroom.app](https://thedataroom.app) and operates in waitlist mode for market validation.

**Session management**
PostgreSQL-backed sessions with automatic cleanup and secure cookie handling. Replit's integrated setup reduced this to a 5-minute configuration versus traditional day-long setup processes.

**Email integration**
Production SMTP integration handles magic link and invitation delivery. Development mode logs emails to console for testing without deliverability concerns.

**File security**
50MB upload limit with type validation and secure storage. Authentication required for uploaded documents; external links use existing cloud service permissions.

## Development timeline

- Week 1: Authentication and data modeling implementation
- Week 2: Document management and UI development
- Week 3: Email system integration and production deployment

Replit eliminated infrastructure bottlenecks including server configuration, database setup, and SSL certificate management.

## Feedback request

The platform demonstrates full-stack TypeScript development patterns with real-world application. Looking for feedback on:

- Developer experience comparisons with other platforms
- Data room workflow effectiveness for startup founders  
- Technical architecture and implementation decisions

**Live platform:** [thedataroom.app](https://thedataroom.app)

**Access:** Waitlist signups receive discounted pricing; investor access remains free.
