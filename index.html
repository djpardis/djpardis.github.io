We are building <a href="https://twitter.com/GeneralFolders" target="_blank">General Folders</a> to provide data infrastructure for business partners. I shared some of the problems we're solving in <a href="https://djpardis.medium.com/data-sharing-and-transfer-challenges-2e87e18a1167" target="_blank">this post</a>. If you're interested in cloud infrastructure and data pipelines, <a href="mailto:pardis@generalfolders.com">let's talk</a>!
</p>

<p>
Prior to General Folders, I built the data function at <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/posts/carbon-health_meet-pardis-noorzad-head-of-data-science-activity-6649426702302871552-DnLa/" target="_blank">Carbon Health</a>. We published a <a href="http://covidclinicaldata.org/" target="_blank">clinical data repository</a> and shared some work at <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CQHwLWMQFDk" target="_blank">AI Summit 2020</a>. I led a data team at <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a> covering consumer products like Search, Trends, Explore, and Notifications. I helped reestablish the <a href="https://medium.com/@djpardis/models-for-integrating-data-science-teams-within-organizations-7c5afa032ebd" target="_blank">product data science</a> function at Twitter.
</p>

<p>
At <a href="http://www.paytmlabs.com" target="_blank">Paytm Labs</a>, I built a fully automated fraud detection engine for <a href="https://paytm.com/" target="_blank">Paytm</a>â€”the payments app serving India. As an early employee at <a href="https://rubikloud.com/" target="_blank">Rubikloud</a>, I built a promotions allocation system that became the company's flagship product.
</p>

<p>
I studied random graph models of online social networks at <a title="MSc in Applied Mathematics at RU" href="http://math.ryerson.ca/graduate/" target="_blank">Ryerson University</a>. At <a title="Department of Computer Engineering" href="http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/computer-engineering/en/home" target="_blank">Amirkabir</a>, I published on <a href="http://cmmr2012.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/sites/cmmr2012.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/files/pdf/papers/cmmr2012_submission_17.pdf" target="_blank">music genre recognition</a> and <a title="Efficient classification based on sparse regression" href="/files/Noorzad2012b.pdf" target="_blank">sparse linear classifiers</a> with <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/bosturm/" target="_blank">Bob L. Sturm</a>. I hold a degree in Software Engineering from the <a title="School of Electrical and Computer Engineering" href="http://ece.ut.ac.ir/en" target="_blank">University of Tehran</a>, where I served as ECE Representative for three years. I served on the Ryerson Senate for a year, working closely with <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sheldon_Levy" target="_blank">Sheldon Levy</a>.
