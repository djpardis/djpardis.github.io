<p>
I am Head of Data Science at <a href="https://carbonhealth.com/" target="_blank">Carbon Health</a>, a technology-enabled healthcare provider designed to make world-class primary and urgent care accessible to all. My team's mission is to improve health outcomes and increase operational efficiency. We maintain a <a href="http://covidclinicaldata.org/" target="_blank">clinical data repository</a> for research purposes.

Previously, I led Connect Data Science at <a href="https://twitter.com/" target="_blank">Twitter</a>. I reestablished the <a href="https://medium.com/@djpardis/models-for-integrating-data-science-teams-within-organizations-7c5afa032ebd" target="_blank">Product Data Science</a> function at the company, ushering its expansion for the first time in four years. At <a href="http://www.paytmlabs.com" target="_blank">Paytm Labs</a>, I designed and built a fully automated fraud detection engine for <a href="https://paytm.com/" target="_blank">Paytm</a>—the P2P payments and marketplace app serving India. At <a href="https://rubikloud.com/" target="_blank">Rubikloud</a>, I proposed and built a promotions allocation system for retailers. This has since become the company's flagship product.

I studied random graph models of online social networks at <a title="MSc in Applied Mathematics at RU" href="http://math.ryerson.ca/graduate/" target="_blank">Ryerson University</a>. At <a title="Department of Computer Engineering" href="http://ceit.aut.ac.ir/autcms/computer-engineering/en/home" target="_blank">Amirkabir University of Technology</a>, I published on <a href="http://cmmr2012.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/sites/cmmr2012.eecs.qmul.ac.uk/files/pdf/papers/cmmr2012_submission_17.pdf" target="_blank">music genre recognition</a> and <a title="Efficient classification based on sparse regression" href="/files/Noorzad2012b.pdf" target="_blank">sparse linear classifiers</a>. I hold a degree in Software Engineering from the <a title="School of Electrical and Computer Engineering" href="http://ece.ut.ac.ir/en" target="_blank">University of Tehran</a>, where I served as ECE Representative for three years. I also served on the Ryerson Senate for a year.
