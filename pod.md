Welcome to the [107 Wins Club](https://107wins.club) podcast, where I host conversations with friends about all aspects of business building. We explore technology trends, share best practices, and talk about learning new things in our ever-changing world.

Why "107 Wins"? The name commemorates the SF Giants' historic 2021 season when they won an incredible 107 regular season games — a franchise record. As dedicated fans who attended way too many games that season, we decided to immortalize that special year in our podcast name.
