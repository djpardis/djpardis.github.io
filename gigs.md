I started DJing in May 2017, playing lunchtime and Tea Time tunes for colleagues at Twitter HQ. Since June 2019, I have been the tour DJ for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6rGjsK7JJpHkUTVtj2PPwf" target="_blank">Sim Simah</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0gvTXbRp8PiAeztLTbbjdX" target="_blank">Aarxn Cxle</a>. This picture is from July 2019 at <a href="https://www.thenewparish.com/" target="_blank">The New Parish</a>, where we were <a href="https://www.thenewparish.com/e/camron-62022556135/" target="_blank">the opening act</a>.
