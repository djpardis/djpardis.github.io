My first gig was in May 2017, playing lunchtime tunes for my colleagues at Twitter HQ. I went on to play at many company events, including <a href="https://qr.ae/pNPCrQ" target="_blank">Tea Time</a>. In June 2019, I became the show DJ for <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/6rGjsK7JJpHkUTVtj2PPwf" target="_blank">Sim Simah</a> and <a href="https://open.spotify.com/artist/0gvTXbRp8PiAeztLTbbjdX" target="_blank">Aarxn Cxle</a>. The picture below is from July 2019 at <a href="https://www.thenewparish.com/" target="_blank">The New Parish</a>, where we were <a href="https://www.thenewparish.com/e/camron-62022556135/" target="_blank">the opening act</a>.

### Song reviews

Every year I write about my favorite songs. It has been a good ritual, motivating me to listen to entire albums rather than just the popular songs.
