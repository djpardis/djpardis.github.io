I started DJing in May 2017 and played [themed Tea Time tunes](https://vimeo.com/463652373) at Twitter HQ. I usually DJed with [Julien Gaillard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/juliengaillard1/) on the [guitar](https://vimeo.com/463687716). In the summer of 2019, I was the tour DJ for [Sim Simah](https://soundcloud.com/ohsimsimah) and [Aarxn Cxle](https://music.apple.com/us/artist/aarxn-cxle/1453179768). The picture above is by [Jesse Meria](https://www.instagram.com/meria.agency/?hl=ne) from July 2019 at [The New Parish](https://www.thenewparish.com/), where we were [the opening act](https://www.teamllfent.com/news/2019/7/30/camron-with-special-guest-troyllf).
